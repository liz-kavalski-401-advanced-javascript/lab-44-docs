"Vue.js is a progressive framework for building user interfaces...The core library is focused on the view layer only, and is easy to pick up and integrate with other libraries or existing projects" -[Vue.js](https://vuejs.org/v2/guide/index.html)

#### Pros
* Vary simaler to React
* Documentation was easy to read
#### Cons
* It can be confuse on set-up

### Ratings and Reviews
#### Documentation
The Documentation were easy to read. It can be in a JS file or Vue, hance can be confusing. Unlike React which uses a JXS, Vue use more of a 'templete' which uses  HTML tags and for some  make it more easier to read. 

#### Systems Requirements
Accoring to the [Installation](https://vuejs.org/v2/guide/installation.html) their are many ways to install vue. As of right now Vue does not support IE8(aka 'Internet Explorer 8) and below, due to using ECMAScript 5/ES5. 
Above and beyond 'node' and 'linux', what dependencies or core requirements exist for this framework? Can it play at AWS/Heroku? Does it require a certain database?

#### Ramp-Up Projections
For a team of mid-junior developer to become productive I would say less then a week depending on the project. 

#### Community Support and Adoption levels
According to [Medium](https://towardsdatascience.com/react-vs-vue-which-is-better-for-2020-c484f22c67a8) it a popular tool used for the front-end right behind of React. As of right now arroding to [Netguru](https://www.netguru.com/blog/13-top-companies-that-have-trusted-vue.js-examples-of-applications) some big companies have used it in parts of projects for example it used in the **Newsfeed** on Facebook in term of marketing. It also growing in term of the JS community and easy to learn compare to React and Angular.
